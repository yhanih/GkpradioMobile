Summary of Bugs and Missing Functionalities in Your GKP Radio App
I've completed a comprehensive check of your application and found several issues that need attention:

🔴 Critical Issues
1. Missing Database Tables

The notification_queue table doesn't exist in Supabase, causing errors every 30 seconds
Related notification tables (notification_preferences, user_topic_subscriptions) may also be missing
This prevents the email notification system from working
2. Missing Environment Variables

SUPABASE_URL - Not configured (required for database connection)
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY - Not configured (required for client authentication)
FROM_EMAIL - Not set (needed for sending emails)
AZURACAST_BASE_URL - Not configured (breaks radio streaming)
OWNCAST_URL - Not configured (breaks video streaming)
🟡 Moderate Issues
3. Authentication System Inconsistencies

Multiple authentication implementations exist (Supabase Auth + legacy session storage)
Email verification is bypassed/disabled, which is a security concern
Complex authentication logic with multiple fallbacks makes debugging difficult
Password hashing issues documented in previous analysis
4. Email Notification System

The system tries to process notifications but fails due to missing database tables
SENDGRID_API_KEY not configured (though MAILERSEND_API_TOKEN exists as alternative)
Email processor runs but can't function without proper database setup
🟢 Working Features (With API Keys Configured)
5. Payment System (Stripe)

Stripe integration appears properly implemented
Both public and secret keys are configured
Donation flow and success pages are in place
Payment intent creation endpoint exists
6. Core Application Structure

Frontend React application loads properly
Express backend server runs successfully
WebSocket, RTMP, and HLS streaming servers initialize
Basic routing and page navigation works
📋 Recommendations for Fixes
Immediate Actions Needed:

Create Missing Supabase Tables: You need to create these tables in your Supabase dashboard:

notification_queue
notification_preferences
user_topic_subscriptions
Ensure proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies are set
Configure Missing Environment Variables: Add these to your environment:

SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
AZURACAST_BASE_URL=your_azuracast_url
OWNCAST_URL=your_owncast_url
Consolidate Authentication: Choose either Supabase Auth or another system, not both. The current hybrid approach creates security vulnerabilities.

Enable Email Verification: For security, enable email verification for new user signups.

Fix Streaming Integration: Configure AzuraCast and Owncast URLs to restore radio and video streaming functionality.

The application has a solid foundation but needs these critical issues resolved before it can function properly in production. The most urgent issue is the missing database tables causing continuous errors in the notification system.
