🔁 WHAT YOU FIXED / IMPROVED ✅
✅ Better Radio Section (Player)
Now shows a real program name: “Morning Faith Talk” is far more engaging than just a gray card with a clock.

Host identity “Pastor David Miller” gives it warmth.

“Mon–Fri” label is clear and helps set listener expectations.

✅ Hero Copy Hierarchy
The section reads cleaner, more intentional.

“Faith Journey” still pops, but now it feels like it’s not fighting as much with the player.

✅ More Aligned Stats Section
2.5K+ → 8.2K → 45K → 24/7 now reads left-to-right properly and feels more coherent.

Use of colors now suggests distinct buckets of value.

✅ Footer Layout Tweaks
Sub-sections are clearer.

Removed some visual clutter and organized links better.

✅ More Consistent Tag Styling in the Story Cards
"Hot" tag and category tags are more readable now.

😐 WHAT’S STILL MID / MISSED (And Holding You Back)
⚠️ Hero CTAs Still Too Equal
Start Listening and Join Community are identical in weight — that’s bad UX.

One is a temporary action (listen once).

One is a platform commitment (build recurring engagement).

Fix: Use a primary (e.g., green for “Join Community”), and ghost style for “Start Listening”.

⚠️ Radio Player Still Feels Static
You changed content, not interaction.

It still doesn’t scream live radio — the most important emotion on a radio site.

Fix Ideas:

Add a pulsing “LIVE” badge or animated waves.

Show “Now Playing” and allow listening directly.

Embed volume or like/share buttons directly inside it.

Swipeable carousel UI for future/past shows.

⚠️ 404 Page Still Disrupts the Flow
It's still integrated visually into the homepage, as if it’s just another section.

404 is a rupture, and it should feel like one—but gently, and with options.

Fix Ideas:

Make a full-width soft graphic (e.g., lost sheep, radio static).

Add a strong CTA: “Go Back Home” and “Explore Faith Stories”.

⚠️ “Listen on Your Favorite Platform” Still Too Basic
These are huge brand assets, but you’re treating them like boring buttons.

Fix:

Add taglines under logos:

Spotify – “Stream anytime, anywhere”

Apple – “On your morning walk”

Animate or hover-highlight logos for interactivity.

⚠️ Bottom Bar Still Feels Buggy
The “LIVE” stream bottom-left feels detached.

No visual indication it connects to current stream.

The audio control bottom-right is still non-functional / unclear.

Fix:

Make this a persistent player bar: show what’s playing now, with title, play/pause, and volume.

If you want serious retention, this bar needs love — think Spotify web.

💡 NEXT-LEVEL SUGGESTIONS
Here’s what to focus on now that V1.5 is nearly complete:

Priority	Improvement	Why
🔴 High	Hero CTA hierarchy	Drives engagement. Right now users have no clear first action.
🔴 High	Live Radio Player functionality	This is the heartbeat of your site. It must feel alive.
🟡 Medium	404 Page redesign	Prevent bounce; redirect user journey quickly.
🟡 Medium	Sticky footer player bar	Encourages extended session times, like podcast sites.
🟢 Low	Tag hover effects + animation	Adds polish and improves perceived quality.

🧠 UX STRATEGY REFOCUS
You’re building not just a faith-based content site — you’re building a daily rhythm platform. So your design needs to reflect:

Consistency: Live = always available. Users should never feel like the site is asleep.

Trust: Show faces, show interactivity, avoid generic placeholders.

Engagement Loops: Join → Comment → Return → Share → Listen Again.

✅ FINAL VERDICT
Score: 7.8 / 10
🔥 Much better than most no-code builds. You’re 1–2 iterations away from a launch-ready v1.
Keep the pressure on the functional feel, not just visual polish.

If you want, I can create:

A task board for this in Lovable

A Figma-style wireframe update mock

A version of this site flow modeled after popular faith radio apps (like K-Love or Air1)

Just say the word.
