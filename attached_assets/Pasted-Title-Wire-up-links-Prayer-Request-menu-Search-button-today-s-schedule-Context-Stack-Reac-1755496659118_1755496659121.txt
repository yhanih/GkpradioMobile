Title: Wire up links + Prayer Request menu + Search button (today’s schedule)

Context
- Stack: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript (frontend), Express.js + TypeScript (backend), PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM.
- Router: use the current app router (keep existing conventions).
- Goal: Verify and fix link interactions. Make “Prayer Request” in Community main menu open the correct category view. Make the Search button open the search UI and actually query content.

Tasks

1) Link audit + fixes
- Crawl app nav: header, footer, sidebar, mobile menu.
- Replace any dead anchors with proper <Link>/<a> targets.
- Ensure all targets render a valid page (no 404, no blank views).
- Keep URLs consistent and readable.

2) Community main menu → Prayer Request category
- Add/confirm a top-level menu item: “Prayer Requests”.
- Route: choose the existing pattern. Prefer one of:
  - /community/prayer-requests
  - /community?category=prayer-requests
- The category page must:
  - Filter posts to the “Prayer Requests” category.
  - Show pagination and empty state.
  - Preserve query params on navigation.
- If the category doesn’t exist in seed data, add it via Drizzle migration/seed.
- Deep link behavior:
  - Clicking a specific prayer item opens its detail route.
  - Back returns to the filtered list with scroll position restored.

3) Search button → search contents
- Make the Search button open a dedicated route: /search.
- Auto-focus the search input on page load.
- Query param: ?q=<term>.
- Results sections (as available in codebase): posts, users, events. Show counts, lazy-load lists.
- Press Enter submits; clear icon resets; Esc blurs/closes on modal variants.
- Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+K (Cmd+K on macOS) to focus the search input.
- Accessibility: label the input; ARIA live region for results count.

4) QA + tests
- Add Playwright tests:
  - Nav links resolve without 404.
  - Community → Prayer Requests shows only that category.
  - Search route reads/writes ?q and renders results.
- Add a simple link-check script for internal routes (fail CI on 404).
- Verify on mobile viewports and dark mode.

5) Deliverables
- Updated nav config/components.
- Category route/page (or filter logic) for Prayer Requests.
- /search route + UI + hooks.
- Drizzle seed/migration if category missing.
- Playwright tests + link-check script.
- Short README note: routes, how to run tests.

Acceptance criteria
- All primary nav links work on desktop and mobile.
- “Prayer Requests” menu item opens a category-scoped list with pagination and empty state.
- /search loads, focuses input, accepts ?q, displays results sections, supports Ctrl/Cmd+K.
- No internal 404s during link-check. Tests pass in CI.

Run commands (adjust to repo):
- Dev: npm run dev
- E2E: npx playwright install && npm run test:e2e
- Link check: npm run check:links
