Looking at the error in the console logs, I can see the main issue: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isPlaying')". This is happening because the HeroSection component is trying to access status and controls props that aren't being passed to it.

Let me fix this by updating the component to use the AudioContext directly, and then address your request about persistent audio playback across pages.

Fix 1: HeroSection Component Error
client/src/components/HeroSection.tsx
Fix undefined props error by using AudioContext directly
Fix 2: Update Index.tsx to Remove Props
client/src/pages/Index.tsx
Remove props from HeroSection component call
Fix 3: Persistent Audio Across Pages
The great news is that your app is already set up for persistent audio! The AudioContext uses a shared global audio instance (sharedAudio) that persists across page navigation. However, I can see a few other buttons throughout the site that might need similar fixes.

Let me check and fix other potential play buttons:

client/src/components/Header.tsx
Add AudioContext integration to header play button if it exists
Looking at your current setup, the audio should already persist across pages because:

Global Audio Context: Your AudioContext uses a shared sharedAudio instance that lives outside React components
Provider Wrapper: Your entire app is wrapped in <AudioProvider> in App.tsx
Persistent State: The audio state is maintained globally
If the music stops when changing pages, it might be due to one of these issues:

Potential Issues & Solutions:
Multiple Audio Instances: Make sure no other components are creating separate audio elements
Page Reload: If you're doing full page reloads instead of SPA navigation, that would stop audio
Component Unmounting: Check if any components are calling audio.pause() on unmount
Let me also check for any other play buttons that might need fixing:

client/src/pages/Live.tsx
Ensure Live page uses shared AudioContext for consistency
Testing the Fix
After these changes:

The HeroSection error should be resolved - no more undefined props
Audio should persist across pages - the shared audio instance continues playing
All play buttons work consistently - they all use the same AudioContext
To test persistent audio:

Click "Start Listening" on the home page
Navigate to Live, Community, or Videos pages
Audio should continue playing
The bottom AudioPlayer should show the correct playing state
The key is that your AudioContext already uses a single shared audio element (sharedAudio) that exists outside of React's component lifecycle, so it naturally persists across page changes in your SPA.
