Thanks for the clarification — you're right to be precise: we want to **fix the user info issue without breaking the UI layout or design flow**.

Here’s a refined message you can send to the Replit agent (or use as an internal dev note), keeping the focus on preserving UI integrity:

**📌 Task: Properly Display Dynamic User Info Without Breaking the UI**

Hey team,

Currently, posts are showing `"Unknown user"` or `"Loading user data..."` in the UI. This is **not acceptable** for a community platform like ours, especially when we're supposed to highlight who posted what, and from where.

### ✅ What needs to happen:

1. For each post (original or reply), we need to **dynamically render the user’s chosen name and location** — like:

   ```
   test-909@Louisville, USA
   ```

2. This info already exists from when the user signs up or fills their profile. No need to track or guess anything.

3. If no info is given, then fallback to:

   ```
   Anonymous@Unknown
   ```

### ❌ What we want to avoid:

* Don’t break or overflow the UI layout.
* Avoid janky loads like “Loading user data…” in the final render.
* Don’t use placeholder constants — must be **live and reactive to user data**.
* Absolutely **no IP-based guessing or tracking.** Users choose what shows.

---

### ✅ UI Preservation Notes:

* Font size, padding, and alignment should be exactly like the existing "Unknown User" line to keep the card structure stable.
* Keep the same spacing/margin as currently shown in `.post-author` class (or whatever is used).
* If async user data loading is still required, make sure the component has a loading state that **reserves space**, so there's no layout shift.

---

### Suggested UI Component Logic (Pseudo-code):

```jsx
<PostAuthor>
  {user?.username && user?.location ? (
    `${user.username}@${user.location}`
  ) : (
    'Anonymous@Unknown'
  )}
</PostAuthor>
```

Let me know if I should help write the actual React or HTML code for this — but the priority is: **no UI breakage, real user info shown, fully dynamic.**

---

Would you like me to also write a fallback UI skeleton loader so that there's no flashing on load?
