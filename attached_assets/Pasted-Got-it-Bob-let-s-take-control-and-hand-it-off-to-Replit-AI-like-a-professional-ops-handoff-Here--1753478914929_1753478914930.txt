Got it, Bob — let’s take control and hand it off to Replit AI like a professional ops handoff. Here's a **fully structured prompt** tailored for Replit's AI Coding Assistant that contains **everything it needs** to finish the job **and fix the Owncast + OBS streaming integration**. You just copy-paste this entire thing into Replit’s AI prompt box:

🚨 MISSION BRIEFING: Configure streaming from Windows OBS to Owncast running on my Ubuntu VPS 🚨

👤 User: Bob  
🗺️ Context: I am streaming from OBS Studio on my **Windows 10** laptop. I want my **Owncast stream** hosted on my VPS to embed live video into a **Replit-hosted frontend website**.

---

## 🖥️ VPS INFO
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (x86_64)
- IP Address: `74.208.102.89`
- Owncast is located at: `/opt/owncast/owncast/`
- Owncast binary: `/opt/owncast/owncast/owncast`
- FFmpeg path: `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`
- RTMP Port: `1935`
- Web UI Port: `8080`

Owncast was installed using the installer script (`https://owncast.online/install.sh`) and is already running via systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl status owncast
````

Shows: ✅ active (running)

Confirmed:

```bash
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN | grep 1935
```

\=> Shows it's listening on `1935`

---

## 🔒 STREAM KEY

My stream key is: `gkpAdmin2025@`

OBS Settings should point to:

```
Stream URL: rtmp://74.208.102.89:1935/live
Stream Key: gkpAdmin2025@
```

---

## ❌ PROBLEM

Streaming from OBS on Windows fails:

> "Failed to connect to server. Connection timed out."

BUT when I check from the VPS:

```
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN | grep 1935
```

it confirms Owncast is listening on `*:1935`

---

## 🧠 WHAT YOU (REPLIT AI) SHOULD DO

1. 🧱 **Check if port 1935 is publicly open**

   * Use a tool like `netcat`, `nmap`, or suggest `ufw`/cloud provider config to make sure port 1935 is open from **external (public) access**, not just internal.

2. 🔧 **Create or verify Owncast config.yaml**

   * If `/opt/owncast/owncast/config.yaml` does NOT exist, create one and make sure it allows RTMP on 1935.
   * Sample block to include:

     ```yaml
     rtmp:
       enabled: true
       port: 1935
     web:
       port: 8080
     ffmpegPath: /usr/bin/ffmpeg
     ```

3. 🔁 **Restart Owncast**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart owncast
   ```

4. 🧪 **Test external port from Replit side**

   * Recommend user run:

     ```powershell
     Test-NetConnection 74.208.102.89 -Port 1935
     ```

     from Windows. If fails, suggest firewall or ISP blocking.

5. 📦 **Provide final Replit HTML embed code**

   * Give me a simple iframe block to embed the Owncast player into my website.

🎯 GOAL:
Make it possible for OBS on my Windows laptop to stream to `rtmp://74.208.102.89:1935/live` using the key `gkpAdmin2025@`, and display the live video on my Replit-based frontend.

Assume I have full root access to the VPS.

DO NOT ask me questions. Just perform what is missing and tell me what exact step to do or script to run.

Let’s go. 🎬

```

This prompt is comprehensive, structured, and gives Replit AI zero excuses to get confused. You’ll hand off the baton cleanly.

Let me know if you want a version that includes the **Replit frontend embed HTML** too.
