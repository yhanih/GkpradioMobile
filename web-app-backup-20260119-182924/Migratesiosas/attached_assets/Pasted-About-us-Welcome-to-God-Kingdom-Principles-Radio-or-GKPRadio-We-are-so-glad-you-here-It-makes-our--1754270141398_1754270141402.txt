About us
Welcome to God Kingdom Principles Radio or GKPRadio! We are so glad you here. It makes our heart rejoice each time.  The mission of GKPRadio is to counteract this trend by spreading the knowledge of God’s Kingdom to the world through a variety of channels such as teaching, prayer, music, meditation,  marriage, family, and finances. This is a powerful platform for educating individuals, families, and communities on the life-changing principles of God that empower believers to live in harmony with His will. The station’s efforts to emphasize God’s principles in practical ways allow listeners to connect spiritual wisdom with real-world issues.

One of the most important aspects of this mission is the realization that the lack of knowledge is not just about not knowing information, but about being disconnected from the Source of all wisdom: God Himself. Without understanding His ways, we find ourselves disconnected from His provision, His protection, and His purpose for our lives. In a society that often values information over wisdom, GKPRadio’s commitment to promoting knowledge that is grounded in the Word of God is a vital service to its listeners.

The Bible speaks clearly on the importance of knowledge in transforming the lives of believers. In Proverbs 2:6, it says, “For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” This divine knowledge equips us to make decisions that align with God’s will, leading to peace and fulfillment. Whether in the context of marriage, family, or finances, the principles of the Kingdom of God provide a framework for living a life that honors God and reflects His love.

Take marriage, for example. In today’s world, marriages are often strained by misunderstandings, poor communication, and the lack of mutual respect. However, when couples apply God’s principles of love, respect, and unity, as found in scriptures like Ephesians 5:25-33, they experience healing, restoration, and growth. Knowledge of God’s Word provides a blueprint for building strong, lasting marriages—relationships that mirror Christ’s love for the church.

In the area of finance, many people struggle with debt, poor financial decisions, and a lack of resources. God’s Word offers practical advice on how to manage money wisely, how to give generously, and how to steward resources with integrity. Proverbs 3:9-10 encourages believers to honor God with their wealth, promising that He will provide abundantly in return. Knowledge of these biblical financial principles helps individuals and families experience prosperity, not only financially but also spiritually.

Prayer and meditation are also key elements in obtaining the knowledge that is vital to our spiritual growth. Through prayer, we open the door for God to speak into our lives, offering guidance, wisdom, and comfort. Meditation on His Word allows His truth to sink deep into our hearts, shaping our attitudes, behaviors, and perspectives. As we engage in these spiritual practices, we grow in understanding and align ourselves more closely with God’s will.

At the core of GKPRadio’s mission is the restoration of the family unit. Families are the bedrock of society, and when the family unit is strengthened, society as a whole flourishes. Knowledge of God’s principles regarding family roles, parenting, and the covenant of marriage is essential for creating loving, nurturing environments where individuals can thrive. God’s design for the family is one of love, respect, and mutual care, where each member supports one another and grows in faith.

As families embrace God’s wisdom, they break generational cycles of dysfunction and establish legacies of faith, peace, and prosperity. When parents model biblical principles, children are equipped to live lives that honor God and reflect His love to the world.

The message of Hosea 4:6 is clear: the lack of knowledge leads to destruction, but the pursuit of divine wisdom leads to life. In every area of life, from marriage and family to finances and personal growth, God’s Word provides the knowledge needed to navigate the challenges we face. GKPRadio is fulfilling a vital role by making this knowledge accessible, relevant, and practical for its listeners.
