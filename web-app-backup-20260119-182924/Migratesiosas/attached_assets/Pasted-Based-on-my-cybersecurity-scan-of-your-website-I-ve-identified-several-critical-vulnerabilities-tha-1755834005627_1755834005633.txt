Based on my cybersecurity scan of your website, I've identified several critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention. Here's my comprehensive security assessment:
🚨 CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND
1. HTTP Fallback Vulnerability (Your Specific Concern)

Location: server/routes.ts lines 273, 309, 340, 373
Risk Level: HIGH

// VULNERABLE: Unencrypted HTTP fallback
response = await fetch('http://74.208.102.89:8080/hls/stream.m3u8');

Impact: Streaming data transmitted over unencrypted HTTP, exposing audio/video content to man-in-the-middle attacks.
2. Additional HTTP Exposure

Risk Level: HIGH

    client/src/components/SimpleCustomPlayer.tsx line 78
    client/src/components/CustomIframePlayer.tsx line 140
    client/src/components/BroadcastDashboard.tsx line 74

These components load video/audio streams over HTTP, creating security vulnerabilities and browser mixed-content warnings.
3. Hardcoded Secrets & Configuration

Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH

// server/auth.ts line 28 - Weak default JWT secret
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || "your-secret-key-change-this";

// server/streaming-routes.ts - Hardcoded infrastructure details
const AZURACAST_BASE_URL = 'https://74.208.102.89:8080';
const STATION_ID = 1;

4. Information Disclosure

Risk Level: MEDIUM

    Multiple console.log statements in production code that could leak sensitive information
    IP addresses and server details exposed in error logs
    Detailed error messages returned to clients

5. Mixed Content Security Issues

Risk Level: MEDIUM
Your HTTPS site loading HTTP resources creates:

    Browser security warnings
    Content blocking by modern browsers
    User experience degradation

🔒 RECOMMENDED SECURITY FIXES
Immediate Actions Required:

    Fix HTTP Fallbacks - Replace all HTTP requests with HTTPS-only:

// Remove HTTP fallback completely
response = await fetch('https://74.208.102.89:8080/hls/stream.m3u8');

    Secure Environment Variables - Ensure all secrets are properly configured:

# Add to your production environment
JWT_SECRET=<generate-strong-random-32-char-string>
AZURACAST_API_KEY=<your-actual-api-key>

    Update Hardcoded URLs - Move to environment variables:

const AZURACAST_BASE_URL = process.env.AZURACAST_BASE_URL;

    Sanitize Logging - Remove or encrypt sensitive data in logs

Additional Security Enhancements:

✅ Good Security Found:

    Helmet.js for security headers
    Rate limiting implemented
    Anti-spam protection with honeypots
    CORS properly configured
    Input validation with Zod schemas

🎯 PRIORITY ACTIONS

Week 1 (Critical):

    Replace all HTTP URLs with HTTPS
    Generate and configure strong JWT secrets
    Remove HTTP fallback logic

Week 2 (Important):

    Move hardcoded configurations to environment variables
    Audit and sanitize all logging statements
    Test SSL certificate validity for streaming server

Week 3 (Recommended):

    Implement request/response encryption for sensitive API calls
    Add CSP headers for streaming content
    Set up security monitoring
