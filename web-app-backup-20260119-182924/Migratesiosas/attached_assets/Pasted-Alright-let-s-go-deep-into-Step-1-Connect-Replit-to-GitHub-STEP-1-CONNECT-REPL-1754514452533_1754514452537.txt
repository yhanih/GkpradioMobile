Alright — let’s go deep into **Step 1: Connect Replit to GitHub**.

## 🛠️ STEP 1: CONNECT REPLIT TO GITHUB (IN DETAIL)

### 🎯 Goal:

Let Replit sync your code with a GitHub repository, so all changes you make can later be deployed to IONOS.

---

### ✅ Requirements Before You Start:

* A **GitHub account** (sign up at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don’t have one).
* A **Replit project** already created with your website files.
* Your project should be stored in a **private** or **public GitHub repository** (you can create it from Replit).

---

### 🔁 Process Overview:

Replit integrates Git like this:

```
Replit → GitHub → IONOS
```

---

### 🧭 FULL STEP-BY-STEP:

#### 📌 A. Open Your Replit Project

1. Go to [replit.com](https://replit.com) and log in.
2. Open the project you want to connect to GitHub (your website).

---

#### 📌 B. Initialize Git in Replit

If you’ve never used Git on this project:

1. Click the **Git icon** (left sidebar — usually under the "Tools" tab).
2. You’ll see an option: **“Connect to GitHub”** or **“Create Git Repo”**.

---

#### 📌 C. Authorize Replit with GitHub

1. If it’s your first time:

   * Click **“Connect to GitHub”**
   * Replit will redirect you to GitHub.
   * Authorize Replit to access your GitHub account (read/write access to repos).

2. If already connected:

   * It’ll ask you to choose or create a repository.

---

#### 📌 D. Create the GitHub Repo

1. Replit will show a form:

   * **Repo name** → (e.g., `gkp-radio`)
   * **Visibility** → Choose **public** or **private**
2. Click **“Create Repository”**
3. Replit now links your project to that GitHub repo.

---

#### 📌 E. Commit & Push Code

Now you’ll see the Git sidebar with options:

* `Unstaged Changes`
* Buttons: **Commit**, **Push**

To push your project:

1. Add a message in the **commit message** box:
   Example: `Initial commit`
2. Click **Commit**
3. Then click **Push**

This sends your full codebase from Replit to GitHub.

---

### 📂 BONUS: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Open the repo you just created (e.g., `yourname/gkp-radio`)
3. You should see all your files there.

✅ **Congrats!** Your Replit code is now version-controlled and GitHub-connected.
