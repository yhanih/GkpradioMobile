Pitch:

GKP Radio isn't just a traditional radio station—it's a dynamic, faith-driven, multimedia community hub. We’re moving away from just being a platform for streaming audio to becoming a socially engaging digital space that brings people together through faith-based content and community interaction. We’re looking to integrate the latest web technologies to foster user engagement, with features like live-streaming, on-demand podcasting, and real-time community discussions.

Our main goal is to provide a platform where people can connect over shared faith and personal growth, all while consuming high-quality content—whether that’s a Sunday service, a Bible study session, or engaging conversations on topics of spirituality and well-being.

We want to create a seamless experience where users can interact with content, whether through personal profiles, commenting, sharing, or even hosting discussions. Beyond just listening, we want to foster a sense of community ownership, so every user feels like they belong. The tech side will be grounded in modern web development, utilizing AI-based recommendation systems to personalize the content experience and user analytics to ensure we’re always improving the platform.

Think of it as faith-based social media meets radio—with the freedom to experience, contribute, and grow within the context of a community that shares your values.

Key Features for Development:

    Live Audio/Video Streaming: For real-time interactions.

    Podcast-style Content: Users can access sermons, interviews, and more, on demand.

    Community Interactions: Dynamic discussions, user profiles, and sharing features.

    Personalized Content Delivery: AI recommendations for tailored content.

    Multi-Platform Integration: Connect the site with social media, live streaming, and mobile apps.

We want to make sure that as a coder, you’ll have the chance to work with cutting-edge web technologies, AI systems, and build something that’s genuinely impacting lives in a faith-based context.
