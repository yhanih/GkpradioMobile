After the section shown in the image (the "SPONSORED BY" bar with multiple "ADVERTISE HERE" slots), create a new section for sponsors.

This new section should be a horizontal scroll bar (carousel-style) that dynamically displays our sponsors' names and logos.

Requirements:

Add this section right after the current sponsor banner.

It should be responsive and look clean on both desktop and mobile.

Each item in the scroll should include:

Sponsor logo (image)

Sponsor name (text)

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a library like SwiperJS or SlickJS for smooth scrolling if needed).

Style it with a modern look—think smooth scrolling, some spacing between logos, and hover effects (like scale or shadow).

Placeholder logos and names can be used for now (e.g., "Sponsor 1", logo1.png, etc.).3

Those logos should be able to cliccked on and then each one of them willl lead to on siglnle After building the sponsor scroll bar, implement logic so that clicking on a sponsor logo opens a dedicated profile page for that sponsor.

🔁 If sponsor data exists, show their landing page.
🚫 If no sponsor is linked to the clicked logo (i.e., it's just a placeholder), show a default "Advertise Here" call-to-action page, modeled after the visual style in the last uploaded image.

🧠 Logic & Routing:
Use dynamic routes like /sponsor/:id or /sponsor/:slug

When a user clicks a sponsor logo:

If sponsor exists in data:
→ render that sponsor’s profile page

If no match in data:
→ render a default “Advertise Here” page with:

Placeholder visuals (like the logo grid image)

A CTA that leads to the subscription package section (e.g. #plans)

🧱 Profile Page Structure (when sponsor exists):
Header with logo + name

Hero tagline (e.g. “Powering Tomorrow”)

Testimonial or description

Sponsorship plan tier (if applicable)

"Visit Website" or "Contact Us" buttons

🚧 Fallback “Advertise Here” Page (when sponsor doesn't exist):
Large central message:

"Your Logo Could Be Here."

Clean design inspired by the image of the logo grid you uploaded

Subtext: "Click below to promote your business with us."

CTA button: "See Sponsor Packages" → anchor link to #sponsorship-plans or /promote

Optional animated placeholder logos cycling

💻 Implementation:
Use HTML + JavaScript routing (or your framework/router)

Data-driven approach (store sponsor info in JSON or CMS)

Render content based on match/no-match condition
