You’re trying to build a public-facing radio website using Replit that integrates AzuraCast for live streaming, but Replit’s full-stack audit just gave you a red flag 🚩: the core streaming infrastructure is broken, the AzuraCast integration is fake/placeholder, and critical backend issues are unresolved.

Let me challenge a few assumptions to sharpen your thinking:
🔍 Key Assumptions You're Making (Let’s Examine):

    "I can just plug in AzuraCast later."
    → ❌ False. The entire streaming stack depends on AzuraCast being reachable, authenticated, and properly connected. Placeholder links = broken functionality.

    "Replit should be able to host my full app."
    → ⚠️ Partially true. Replit is great for prototyping, but RTMP/WebSocket streaming + real-time audio servers are heavy and don’t run well on Replit unless you have a lot of DevOps scaffolding.

    "Frontend looks great, so it's almost ready."
    → ❌ Looks aren't enough. You’re building a radio platform—if the streaming doesn’t work, the site fails its main purpose.

✅ Here’s What You Should Do Next (Prompt-Wise)

Your next prompt to Replit or your coding assistant should focus on Phase 1: Streaming Infrastructure Recovery—the most blocking part. Here's a full version you can copy-paste:

    Prompt:

    ✅ Let's fix Phase 1: Core Streaming Infrastructure.

        Replace broken WebRTC logic with proper RTMP integration.

        Connect to my real AzuraCast server at http://74.208.102.89:8000.

        Fix /api/stream/status to return real AzuraCast metadata (JSON).

        Set up WebSocket management for stream state updates (optional fallback if AzuraCast is unreachable).

        Document expected response format from AzuraCast API and map it into my frontend player.

    🎯 Goal: I want to hear a stream from AzuraCast playing on the frontend, even if it's just a test MP3 loop.

    Use my real AzuraCast station, not placeholder URLs. Assume it’s public-facing and Icecast is running on port 8000.
