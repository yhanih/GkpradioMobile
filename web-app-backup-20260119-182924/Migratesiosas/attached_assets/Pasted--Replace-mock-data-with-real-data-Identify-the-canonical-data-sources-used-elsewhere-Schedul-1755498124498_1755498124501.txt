) Replace mock data with real data
- Identify the canonical data sources used elsewhere:
  - Schedule and “today’s schedule” come from events/schedule tables or /api/events-like endpoints.
- Add or reuse backend endpoints:
  - GET /api/schedule?date=YYYY-MM-DD&tz=America/Kentucky/Louisville
  - Any other content the page shows must come from existing tables and relations.
- On the frontend:
  - Use TanStack Query with a stable queryKey.
  - Map backend fields to UI props exactly.
  - Add loading and empty states.
  - Convert times with the America/Kentucky/Louisville timezone.

2) Ensure link buttons lead to real routes
- Audit all buttons and links visible on this page.
- For each button:
  - Point to an existing route. If a target route does not exist, either:
    - Create a minimal placeholder route that renders a basic page, or
    - Hide the button until the route exists.
- Preserve current button styles and layout.

3) Remove hero section and top whitespace
- Remove the hero component on this page only.
- Collapse negative space at the top. Adjust container padding/margins so content starts near the top without shifting other elements.
- Do not change typography, colors, or card layouts.

4) Data consistency checks
- The schedule shown here must match the schedule shown on other pages for the same date.
- If the page filters by “today,” pass today’s date on the server or derive it on the client once, not per component.
- Add a small “source-of-truth” selector function to keep field names consistent.

5) Tests and QA
- React tests:
  - Renders real data from a mocked /api/schedule response.
  - Buttons navigate to existing routes.
  - No hero and no excessive top spacing.
- Playwright smoke tests:
  - Page loads without console errors.
  - Clicking each visible button opens a real page (status 200).
- Linters and type checks must pass.

Deliverables
- Updated server route(s) or reuse of existing ones with docs.
- Frontend data hooks and mapping for the page.
- Link fixes or conditional hides for missing routes.
- Removal of hero on this page and spacing adjustments.
- Tests (unit + e2e) and a short README note describing the endpoints and how the page pulls schedule data.

Acceptance criteria
- Visual UI matches current design, except the hero is removed and top whitespace is reduced.
- The page shows accurate schedule data that matches our canonical source for the same date and timezone.
- All buttons lead to existing pages or are hidden if a route is not available.
- Tests pass locally and in CI. No 404s from in-app links on this page.
