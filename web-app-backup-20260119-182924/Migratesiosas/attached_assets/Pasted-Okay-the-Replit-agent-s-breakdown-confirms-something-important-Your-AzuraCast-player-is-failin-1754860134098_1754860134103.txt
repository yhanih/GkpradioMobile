Okay — the Replit agent’s breakdown confirms something important:

Your **AzuraCast player is failing for two separate reasons**:

1. **The API calls are wrong** — it’s trying to hit

   ```
   https://74.208.102.89/api/nowplaying/1
   ```

   when your real AzuraCast API lives at

   ```
   http://74.208.102.89:8081/api/nowplaying/1
   ```

   That `:8081` is missing, which means the request goes to the wrong place → 404 error.

2. **The stream proxy URL is wrong** — your backend is trying to get the MP3 from

   ```
   https://74.208.102.89/listen/gkp_radio/radio.mp3
   ```

   but your station is on **port 8081**, so the real URL should be something like:

   ```
   http://74.208.102.89:8081/listen/gkp_radio/radio.mp3
   ```

## **How to fix AzuraCast in your Replit app**

We’ll need to fix **two spots**:

### 1️⃣ Update API URL in your Replit secrets

Right now, your `AZURACAST_API_URL` is probably set to:

```
https://74.208.102.89
```

You need to change it to:

```
http://74.208.102.89:8081
```

Then restart the app.

---

### 2️⃣ Fix your stream URL in the backend

In your backend code (maybe `AudioContext.tsx` or a config file), find the `listen` stream URL and add the port `:8081` so it looks like:

```
http://74.208.102.89:8081/listen/gkp_radio/radio.mp3
```

This is the actual playable stream from AzuraCast.

## **Testing the Fix**

Before touching Replit, test both URLs in your browser:

* **API Test**
  Visit:

  ```
  http://74.208.102.89:8081/api/nowplaying/1
  ```

  If your station is running, you’ll see JSON with the current track.

* **Stream Test**
  Visit:

  ```
  http://74.208.102.89:8081/listen/gkp_radio/radio.mp3
  ```

  If working, it will start playing music in your browser or prompt a download.

---

If both work, your Replit app will work after you update the values.

If you want, I can give you **the exact Replit secret and backend changes line-by-line** so you can just paste them in and not worry about where to add the port.
Do you want me to prepare that for you?
